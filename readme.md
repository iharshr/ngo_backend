## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ngo-donations-api.git
cd ngo-donations-api
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Database

Edit `config/db.js` and set your PostgreSQL connection URL. Example:

```js
const sequelize = new Sequelize(
	"postgresql://db_owner:password@host:port/db?sslmode=require",
	{ dialect: "postgres", logging: false }
);
```

---

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

> Uses `nodemon` to restart on file changes.

Or run normally:

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see:

```
Starting sync...
Database connected.
Sync complete, starting server...
✅ Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 📬 API Endpoints

### NGO Routes

```
POST /api/ngos
GET /api/ngos
```

### Donation Routes

```
POST /api/donations
GET /api/donations
```

---

## ✅ Todo

- Add input validation
- Add authentication
- Add admin dashboard to review NGO status

---

## 🛠 Dev Tips

- To force DB re-creation: change `sequelize.sync({ force: true })` temporarily.
- Logs are written using `console.log()` for simplicity. Use `winston` or similar in production.
